# HOZHEN's self hosted guide

This repo serves as a learning tool that resumes common pitfall that a linux/proxmox/network noob can fall into while setting up a self-hosted proxmox server.  
The guide is build from parts of the [proxmox official documentation](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/), the [official wiki](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Main_Page) and multiple stack overflow post and other guides.  
Detailled reference will be made for each explanation to give exact solution.
