# HOZHEN's self hosted guide

Welcome to you, fellow self-hosted enthusiast.
This repo serves as a learning tool that resumes some common pitfall that a linux/proxmox/network noob (at least I did) can fall into while setting up a self-hosted proxmox server.  
The guide is build from parts of the [proxmox official documentation](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/), the [official wiki](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Main_Page) and multiple stack overflow post and other guides.  
Detailed reference will be made for each explanation to give exact solution. 

## Pre-requirement
The first step is to decide what will be the use of the server. 
- Will it be to become a media center? 
- Will it be an AI inference machine?
- Will it be a remote working station?
- Will it be a host for your websites?
- Will it be a web3 node?
- Will it be a bot machine?

### Hardware
Once, you've decided what will be principal usage for your self-hosted server and decided that proxmox is the solution
for your need. It is time to build your server starting with the [hardware (official req)](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-virtual-environment/requirements).

There are additional consideration to be taken into account
